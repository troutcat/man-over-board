![In Dresden]({{site.baseurl}}/images/kevin-dresden.jpg)

In the spring of 2012, I traveled with my friend, Mark, to Dresden, Germany, the first city on a three-week trip around central Europe.  We opted for a multi-stop, morning-to-morning flight to save money, a decision we were already regretting as we started flying west from Boston, rather than over the Atlantic toward Germany.  It was about 7am local time when finally we reached our destination.  Neither of us had slept much on the plane, and the last traces of excitement that had kept us awake were rapidly fading, leaving us dead on our feet, in search of plush bedding and heavy rest. Unfortunately, German hotels, like those in America, generally do not allow guests to check in at such an early hour.  Exhausted, anxious, and altogether unprepared to handle the difficulties that come with foreign travel, we left our bags at the front desk, took our skateboards, and headed around the corner to a skatepark that we had spotted while trying to find the hotel.  Stepping foot on my skateboard added a welcome note of comfort to an otherwise stressful morning.  I was finally starting to relax when another skateboarder said something to me in what I presumed to be German.  A deer in front of headlights, my mind raced to think of the one phrase I had tried to memorize on the plane.  Stuttering, and looking to Mark for support, I spoke.

“Ick…spreckin…nickt…doysh.”

Though I am certain my botched attempt at, “I don’t speak German”, did not explicitly say so, the message was crystal clear.

“Oh, English?” he asked, rather fluently.

Flush with embarrassment, my heart rate returned to normal as we struck up a conversation about the one thing we knew we had in common: skateboarding. Mark and I were quickly enlightened to the whereabouts of other parks in the area, and learned all about a man called “Concrete Rudolph”, known for building subpar concrete skateparks around the continent.  Though I am sure a soft bed and a good night’s sleep would have done similar wonders for my outlook, this simple interaction made me feel a mild sense of confidence in a place that had been intimidating up to that point.  Of all the wonderful memories of that trip, this remains one of my fondest.

The preceding anecdote introduced the proposal I submitted for the Bonderman Travel Fellowship, an award presented each year to 14 University of Washington students.  The fellowship allows recipients to travel alone around the world for at least 8 months, visiting at least 6 countries and two distinct regions.  My application proposed that skateboarding is an easy way to meet people anywhere in the world and, as I experienced in Dresden, can make a strange new place feel a little more like home.

Apparently I made a convincing argument, and here I am roughly two months away from my departure to Sarajevo, where I will begin my journey. From August to April, I’ll travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China, and maybe an additional country or two somewhere in between. Along the way I’ll ride my skateboard, and hopefully meet some other people who like to do the same.  I’m not quite sure what to expect aside from the occasional rolled ankle, but I expect that the amount of fun I have will far outweigh any hardships I encounter.  I look forward to the journey ahead.
