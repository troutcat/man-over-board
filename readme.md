##Man Over Board

Source code for Kevin Bicknell's travel blog, http://manoboard.com. ~~, currently under development and hosted as a project page through Github Pages. It will be transferred to the blog owner after all the setup is complete.~~

*This blog/repository is now being maintained over at https://github.com/manoboard/manoboard.github.io.*

####Assorted Notes
* Comments are powered by Disqus (but [this solution by Ivan Zuzak](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html) looks very cool)
* Github's own Markdown Basics tutorial will be a useful reference after I transfer this blog: https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics
* Might consider implementing [custom 404 pages](https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages)
* Social icons from the awesome [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
